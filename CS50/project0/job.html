                <h3>Sorin group - Biomedical Engineer</h3>
                <p>
                    My first job experience after my degree started as a trainee in 2014 in a big biomedical multinational, on the Business Unit where pace-makers and ICD (implantable cardiac defribillator) were made.
                    I was lucky: the job was very close to my thesis experience, to my studies, I loved it!
                    I had to write clinical tests on new devices, recover and perform data analysis on signal from clinical studies, give clinical support to other department on the same Business Unit, ... I liked it very much:
                    we were trying to improve heart performances by changing pacing sites and timings!
                    Also the team was good: some italian in a french group, I had the opportunity to know smart people and important physicians, to travel a bit in Europe (now I know very well Paris and a little of Strasbourg and Maastricht),
                    and to improve my english, my french (a little) and my idea of the world.
                    My experience there went on for 2 years, after which a global re-organization of the company structure made me look around...

                <h3>eVISO - Data Scientist & Energy Trader - Team Leader</h3>
                <p>
                    Eviso was a quite new startup quickly growing; it's an electricity supplier, and my job started in a 3 people team (but the 3rd is my boss, who is responsible also of the billing) in charge of forecasting and buying energy on the market for our client.
                    Now I'm the team leader of this team, that count other 3 other people than me, and we are also trying to reduce risk with financial covers, building report platform and helping the company with business analytics, taking care
                    of tracking internally data flows (but we want to give our service outside, that's why the web programming course!), and I think that our tasks will countinue to grow in number and responsability!
                    But how I ended in an energy company? Because I am an engineer; and here I discovered that I like very much also technology beyond biomedical: data analysis, data interpretation, data mining, software development... I was doing it before, but here I found that I want to do more!
                    And so I started knowing Matlab and Excel, and now I am a Python and SQL expert, I use git to track my code and I'm starting to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript!
                    And from 2018 I am starting to manage a team: this is a tough task!

                <p>
                    Yes, when I was studying I tried to earn some Euros by playing piano and accordion, teaching math and physics to high school students (I was lucky, they wanted to learn, and I loved to teach them),
                    spending some weeks in a mechanical workshop (I'm not so good in welding) and doing some basic accounting...
