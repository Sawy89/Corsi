                What did I do on my studies?
                It has been a long long path, but it's what brought me where I am, and it's what helped me understand what I like to do.
                But what I am completely sure, is that I'm am not at the end, nut in the middle of my training path, and I don't think there is an end!

                <h3>Liceo Scientifico</h3>
                <p>
                    I got my high school scientific diploma in 2008, with vote 100/100.
                    Those 5 years had started like a game, I had known some people, I started to understand what learning was like.
                    But what I learned was that I needed to work with other people to get things done, and that I have to be serious and take my responsability.
                    My high school years teached me mainly a method of studying, that helped me in university, and they gave me some friends that I keep now!

                <h3>Politecnico di Torino - Biomedical Engineering - bachelor degree</h3>
                <p>
                    I liked very much my experience in Turin polytechnic. I had the possibility to start learning a lot of interesting scientific subjects in detail: math, physics, electronics, mechanics, computer science; but 
                    everything with a little bit of biomedical in it! I get my first degree in 2011 with a grade of 110/100 cum laude.

                <h3>Politecnico di Torino - Biomedical Engineering - master degree</h3>
                <p>
                    These last 2 years were very interesting: in every course we went deep into the biomedical part, but without loosing our engineering approach to problem solving.
                    I had the possibility to work and study on Bio-nanotecnology, biomedical signal and images analysis and classification, bio-material, bio-mechanic, bio-microelectronic, implantable devices, reabilitation bioengineering.
                    My "standard" study path ended in 2013 with the thesis on NIRS signal analysis on psychological patients.

                <h3>Fondazione CRT - Progetto Talenti per l'impresa</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2018 I understood that I have to keep learning forever; so I spend some weekends (like 30!) with a bunch of very smart young italian talents!
                    This project was meant to help us be enterpreneurs; a lot of different lecture and projects to teach us business, economy, marketing, team work, leadership, communication, business development, economic and political scenery,
                    creativity and idea generation, agile method. This course opened a lot my mind and my thinking, and I found it very usefull in my current working experience; however at the moment I'm not ready for being an enterpreneur, but who knows the future?

                <h3>Online courses - article - books</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently doing at least 2-3 online courses each year; in fact, this is the first project of an online web programming course from EDx!
                    And then I try to read many articles or books, mainly on software news, leadership advice and team work.
